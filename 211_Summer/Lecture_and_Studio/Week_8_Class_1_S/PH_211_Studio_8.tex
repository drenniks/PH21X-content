\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c||c}
	& $U_{gTB}$ & $K_{TB}$ & $U_{gBB}$ & $K_{BB}$ & $E_{\text{total}}$ \\ \hline

	$t_{f}$ & $mgh_{max}$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $mgh_{max}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{align*}
	mgh_{max} & = mg(h+2R) + Mgh \\
	h_{max} & = h + 2R + \frac{M}{m}h \\
	& = \left(\frac{M}{m}+1\right)h+2R
\end{align*}
You don't necessarily need to include the radius of the basketball, as the tennis ball never gets lower than $2R$. If you leave off $2R$, you are effectively setting the zero of potential for the tennis ball at $2R$ above the ground, and so the $h_{max}$ you would find would actually be measured from this higher point. \\

\noindent Plugging in the given numbers, note that $\frac{M}{m}=15$, so $h_{max} = 8.23$ m. Now, this would exceed the ceiling height in our classroom, but when we actually do the demonstration, the non-negligible bounce of the basketball leads to this being a large overestimate; the tennis ball won't hit the ceiling after being dropped from this height. \\

\noindent However, if you wanted to find out the maximum drop height in the ideal case, it would only take a small rearrangement of the equation:
\begin{align*}
	h = \frac{h_{max}-2R}{\frac{M}{m}+1}.
\end{align*}
Assuming a ceiling height of 3 m, we should drop the ball from less than $h \approx 0.17$ m. In practice, this will be nowhere near the ceiling.

\section*{S8-1: Ball Drop -- Height}
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A tennis ball and a basketball are dropped from a \\
	height $h$ as shown.
	\item Our system is the tennis ball, the basketball, and \\
	the Earth.
	\item If the basketball does not bounce at all, how high does the tennis ball go?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Basketball Mass: $M=0.6$ kg
		\item Basketball Radius: $R \approx 11.5$ cm
		\item Tennis Ball Mass: $m=0.04$ kg
		\item Drop Height: $h=0.5$ m
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{PresentSpace}
\newpage
\begin{TeacherMargin}
\noindent Let us add two times to our table: $t_{bb}$ (right before the bounce) and $t_{ab}$ (right after the bounce).
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c||c}
	& $U_{gTB}$ & $K_{TB}$ & $U_{gBB}$ & $K_{BB}$ & $E_{\text{total}}$ \\ \hline
	$t_{i}$ & $mg(h+2R)$ & $0$ & $Mgh$ & $0$ & $mg(h+2R)+Mgh$ \\ \hline
	$t_{bb}$ & $mg(2R)$ & $\frac{1}{2}mv_{bb}^{2}$ & $0$ & $\frac{1}{2}Mv_{bb}^{2}$ & $mg(2R) + \frac{1}{2}(m+M)v_{bb}^{2}$ \\ \hline
	$t_{ab}$ & $mg(2R)$ & $\frac{1}{2}mv_{ab}^{2}$ & $0$ & $0$ & $mg(2R) + \frac{1}{2}mv_{ab}^{2}$ \\ \hline
	$t_{f}$ & $mgh_{max}$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $mgh_{max}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Note that the extra starting height of the tennis ball really doesn't matter in some of these calculations. It drops the same height as the basketball, and that change in height is what provides the kinetic energy; the extra $2R$ that remains does nothing. This can be seen in how it will cancel out in equations relating $E_{i}$ to $E_{bb}$ or $E_{ab}$. \\

\noindent To find the pre-collision speed, I will choose to set $E_{i}=E_{bb}$ (which isn't the only choice I could make), which gives
\begin{align*}
	mg(h+2R) + Mgh & = mg(2R) + \frac{1}{2}(m+M)v_{bb}^{2} \\
	(m+M)gh & = \frac{1}{2}(m+M)v_{bb}^{2} \\
	v_{bb} & = \sqrt{2gh}.
\end{align*}
To find the post-collision speed, I will choose to set $E_{f}=E_{ac}$ (which isn't the only choice I could make), which gives
\begin{align*}
	mgh_{max} & = mg(2R) + \frac{1}{2}mv_{ab}^{2} \\
	v_{ab} & = \sqrt{2g(h_{max}-2R)} = \sqrt{2gh\left(\frac{M}{m}+1\right)}
\end{align*}
Now, from the impulse-momentum theorem (simplifying the impulse as $\vec{J}_{net} = \vec{F}^{net}_{avg}\Delta t$, and choosing a coordinate system with $\hat{y}$ pointing upward), we have
\begin{align*}
	\vec{F}^{net}_{avg}\Delta t & = \vec{p}_{ab} - \vec{p}_{bb} \\
	F^{net}_{avg}\Delta t& = mv_{ab} - \left(-(m+M)v_{bb}\right) \\
	& = m\sqrt{\frac{M}{m}+1}\sqrt{2gh} + (m+M)\sqrt{2gh} \\
	F^{net}_{avg} & = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{M}{m}+1} + (m+M)}{\Delta t}m\sqrt{2gh}.
\end{align*}
If we want to get just the normal force from the ground, we need to know the force of gravity (which is constant, and therefore equal to its average). Since our system is both balls, the force should be on both, meaning
\begin{align*}
	F^{net}_{avg} & = F^{N}_{avg} - F^{g} \\
	& = F^{N}_{avg} - (m+M)g \\
	F^{N}_{avg} & = F^{net}_{avg} + (m+M)g \\
	& = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{M}{m}+1} + (m+M)}{\Delta t}m\sqrt{2gh} + (m+M)g.
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}

	\item During the collision with the ground, which takes 0.2 s, you may want to choose a different system.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What is the speed of each ball right before the basketball hits the ground?

\begin{TeacherMargin}
\noindent{\color{blue}\textbf{Blue Track}} \\
The blue track changes potential energy to kinetic energy soonest, so the ball accelerates more at the outset and has more speed over more of the distance of the track. \\

\noindent This can also be thought about in terms of forces, as the region with the most slope accelerates the ball the most and happens earliest on this track. \\

\noindent Either way, the ball on the blue track reaches the end first. \\
{\color{yellow}\textbf{Yellow Track}} \\
The yellow track gives the ball constant acceleration.

\noindent{\color{green}\textbf{Green Track}} \\
The green track as less slope (and therefore less acceleration) near both ends, and more slope (and therefore more acceleration) in the middle.

\noindent{\color{red}\textbf{Red Track}} \\
The red track is the slowest. Most of the conversion from $U_{g}$ to $K$ occurs near the end (where the slope, and therefore the force, is greatest), and the ball spends most of its time at a lower speed. \\

\noindent\textbf{All Four} \\
All four tracks have the same change in height, so the balls lose the same amount of potential energy. As such, they all end with the same speed.

\textbf{Three Students} \\
A brief recap of what the students said is given in black, and the colored text discusses their logic.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Same force, $m_{\text{B}}>m_{\text{A}}$, therefore $m_{\text{A}}$ goes faster than $m_{\text{B}}$. \\
	{\color{blue}True by application of Newton's second law.} \\
	$\vec{p}=m\vec{v}$ {\color{blue} True (definition of momentum).}
	\item Speed compensates for mass, so $p_{\text{A},f} = p_{\text{B},f}$. \\
	{\color{violet}False. $m_{\text{A}}$ goes faster, so B will take longer to travel between the two marks. Symbolically, this can be written as $\Delta t_{\text{A}} < \Delta t_{\text{B}}$. $\vec{J} = \int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}\vec{F}^{net}dt$, so for the same force over these two different times, $J_{\text{A}} < J_{\text{B}}$, and since $p_{i}=0$ for both, this means $p_{\text{A},f} < p_{\text{B},f}$.}
	\item $K$ is proportional to $m$ and to $v^{2}$, so a bigger speed will have more effect than a smaller mass, thus $K_{\text{A}}>K_{\text{B}}$. \\
	{\color{violet} False. $W = \int_{\vec{r}_{i}}^{\vec{r}_{f}}\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}$ means $W_{\text{A}} = W_{\text{B}}$, as the blocks have the same force and displacement. The work-energy theorem then tells us that $K_{\text{A}}=K_{\text{B}}$.} \\
	{\color{violet}Also, note that $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=\frac{p^{2}}{2m}$, so if $K_{\text{A}} = K_{\text{B}}$, then}
	\begin{align*}
		\color{violet}
		\frac{p_{\text{A}}^{2}}{2m_{\text{A}}} = \frac{p_{\text{B}}^{2}}{2m_{\text{B}}},
	\end{align*}
	{\color{violet}which can be rearranged to get}
	\begin{align*}
		\color{violet}
		\frac{m_{\text{A}}}{m_{\text{B}}} = \frac{p_{\text{A}}^{2}}{p_{\text{B}}^{2}}.
	\end{align*}
	{\color{violet}Since $\frac{m_{\text{A}}}{m_{\text{B}}} < 1$, this tells us that $p_{\text{A}}<p_{\text{B}}$, giving extra confirmation that (2) is wrong.}

	\end{center}
	\item Three students discuss the final momentum and kinetic energy of each cart.
	\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
		\item \textit{``Since the same force is exerted on both carts, the cart with the smaller mass will move quickly, while the cart with the larger mass will move slowly. The momentum of each cart is equal to its mass times its velocity.''}
		\item \textit{``This must mean that the speed compensates for the mass and the two carts have equal final momenta.''}
		\item \textit{``I was thinking about the kinetic energies. Since the velocity is squared to get the kinetic energy, but mass isn't, the cart with the bigger speed must have more kinetic energy.''}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Do you agree or disagree with the statements made by each student?
	\item Which cart takes longer to travel between the two marks? Explain your reasoning.
