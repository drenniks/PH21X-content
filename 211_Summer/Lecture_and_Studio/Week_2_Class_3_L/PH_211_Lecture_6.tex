If you are sitting on flat ground, waiting to spontaneously start to slide across the floor, you will be waiting for a very long time. In this special case, the answer is (C); it will take an infinite amount of time to reach the end of a horizontal ramp.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item It takes an infinite amount of time to slide ``down'' a horizontal ramp.
		\item As $\theta$ decreases toward zero, $\sin\theta$ also decreases toward zero, which means the denominator of the fraction goes to zero. This will cause the fraction (and thus the equation for $t$) to explode to infinity, thus agreeing with our prediction.

	\item $t$ and $d$
	\begin{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{1a) Understand the Problem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Known:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\Delta x = 200$ m, $\theta = 17^{\circ}$
		\item By assumption: $\vec{a}=-g\hat{y}$, $g\approx9.8$ m/s$^{2}$, $\Delta y = 0$ m
	\end{itemize}
	\item Unknown:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $v_{0}$ (initial speed), $t_{f}$ (time of flight), $v_{f}$ final speed
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{1b) Identify Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Delta y = 0$ m
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Both the arrow and the target are not going to be at ground level, and archery ranges are typically in flat areas, so for simplicity, it won't be too egregious to assume that the arrow starts and ends at the same height.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The arrow is not affected by moving through air.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An arrow is fast and aerodynamic, and we don't really know how to handle air resistance or the effects of wind, so we should ignore these effects to make the problem solvable.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Near Earth's surface ($g\approx9.8$ m/s$^{2}$)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item So far, all known archery occurs on Earth, and the height an arrow flies is not significant enough to worry about variation in gravity.
	\end{itemize}
	\item $\vec{a}=-g\hat{y}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Since the object is in free-fall with no wind or air effects, and it isn't traveling far enough for the curvature of the Earth to matter, acceleration is straight down and purely gravitational.

\noindent\textbf{2a) Represent Principles}

\noindent 2-D Kinematics: {\color{blue}Known} {\color{red}Unknown} {\color{purple}Wanted}
\begin{align*}
	{\color{blue}\Delta x} & = v_{0x}{\color{red}t_{f}} + \frac{1}{2}{\color{blue}a_{x}}{\color{red}t_{f}}^{2} & {\color{blue}\Delta y} & = v_{0y}{\color{red}t_{f}} + \frac{1}{2}{\color{blue}a_{y}}{\color{red}t_{f}}^{2} \\
	{\color{red}v_{fx}} & = v_{0x} + {\color{blue}a_{x}}{\color{red}t_{f}} & {\color{red}v_{fy}} & = v_{0y}+{\color{blue}a_{y}}{\color{red}t_{f}} \\
	{\color{red}v_{fx}}^{2} & = v_{0x}^{2} + 2{\color{blue}a_{x}}{\color{blue}\Delta x} & {\color{red}v_{fy}}^{2} & = v_{0y}^{2} + 2{\color{blue}a_{y}}{\color{blue}\Delta y}
\end{align*}
We can avoid the bottom four equations, since we don't really want to know $v_{f}$. \\
Trigonometry:
\begin{align*}
	v_{0x} & = {\color{purple}v_{0}} \cos{\color{blue}\theta} & v_{0y} & = {\color{purple}v_{0}} \sin{\color{blue}\theta}
\end{align*}
\textbf{2b) Find Unknown(s) Symbolically} \\
Between ${\color{blue}\Delta x} = v_{0x}{\color{red}t_{f}} + \frac{1}{2}{\color{blue}a_{x}}{\color{red}t_{f}}^{2}$ and ${\color{blue}\Delta y} = v_{0y}{\color{red}t_{f}} + \frac{1}{2}{\color{blue}a_{y}}{\color{red}t_{f}}^{2}$, we have four knowns ($\Delta x,\ \Delta y,\ a_{x}, a_{y}$) and three unknowns ($t,\ v_{0x},\ v_{0y}$). However, $v_{0x}$ and $v_{0y}$ are components of $\vec{v}_{0}$, and we know $\theta$, so they are sort of a single shared unknown, as is time. Two equations sharing two unknowns can be solved.
\begin{align*}
	{\color{blue}\Delta y} & = v_{0y}{\color{red}t_{f}} + \frac{1}{2}{\color{blue}a_{y}}{\color{red}t_{f}}^{2} & {\color{blue}\Delta x} & = v_{0x}{\color{red}t_{f}} + \frac{1}{2}{\color{blue}a_{x}}{\color{red}t_{f}}^{2} \\
	0 & = v_{0y}t_{f} - \frac{1}{2}gt_{f}^{2} & \Delta x & = v_{0x}\frac{2v_{0y}}{g} + 0 \\
	& = \left(v_{0y} - \frac{1}{2}gt_{f}\right)t_{f} & & = \frac{2v_{0}^{2}}{g}\cos\theta\sin\theta \\
	0 & = v_{0y} - \frac{1}{2}gt_{f} & v_{0} & = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta x g}{2\sin\theta\cos\theta}} \\
	t_{f} & = \frac{2v_{0y}}{g} & & = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta x g}{\sin(2\theta)}}
\end{align*}
\textbf{2c) Plug in Numbers}
\[
v_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{(200\text{ m})(9.8\text{ m/s}^{2})}{\sin(2\times17^{\circ})}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{19600}{0.559}\frac{\text{m}^{2}}{\text{s}^{2}}} \approx 59.2 \text{ m/s}
\]
If you assume $g \approx 10$ m/s$^{2}$, then $v_{0}\approx59.8$ m/s.

You are a long-distance archer who releases an arrow that hits a target 200 m away. Your arrow makes an initial angle with the horizontal of $17^{\circ}$. Following the steps for solving an A*R*C*S problem, find the initial speed of the arrow.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{C}alculate: Find a \textbf{symbolic expression} for the initial speed of the arrow.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Hint 1:} \textbf{Use the symbols you defined before} to help you choose which kinematics equatiosn to use for the $x$- and $y$-directions.
		\item \textit{Hint 2:} Think about which quantity is the same for the $x$- and $y$-directions.
		\item Wait until the end to plug in numbers!
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{PresentSpace}
\newpage
\begin{TeacherMargin}
\noindent\textbf{3a) Units} \\
We want $[v_{0}] = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$, and we know $[\Delta x]=\text{m}$, $[g]=\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^{2}}$, and $[\sin(2\theta)]=1$ (unitless), so
\[
[v_{0}] = \sqrt{\frac{[\Delta x][g]}{[\sin(2\theta)]}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{m}\cdot\text{m}/\text{s}^{2}}{1}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{m}^{2}}{\text{s}^{2}}}
\]
Note that I got a bit of a free unit check by plugging in numbers with units in 2c. \\
\textbf{3b) Numbers} \\
Converting into miles per hour, we find that $v_{0} \approx 132$ mph. According to a quick internet search, the speed of a recurve bow shot is around 150 mph (around 204 mph for a compound bow), so we are in the right neighborhood. \\
Side Note: In Olympic archery, the target is set 70 m from the archer, so the given $\Delta x = 200$ m is rather large in comparison to modern competition. \\
\textbf{3c) Symbols}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Delta x$ increases
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the range increases, the arrow must cover a greater distance before it hits the ground, so one would expect it to travel faster.
		\item $v_{0}$ increases as $\Delta x$ increases, so our equation matches this prediction.
	\end{itemize}
	\item $g$ increases
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $g$ increases (say we do archery on Jupiter), then the arrow will be dragged to the ground more quickly, so it must go faster to cover the same distance in less time.
		\item $v_{0}$ increases as $g$ increases, so our equation matches this prediction.
	\end{itemize}
	In both of the above, it is worth noting that increasing $v_{0}$ not only helps the arrow cover horizontal distance faster, but also increases its time of flight by giving it more vertical speed.
	\item $\theta$ increases
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This one isn't as easy. Note the graph of $\sin(2\theta)$:
		\vspace{-10pt}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
				\draw[thick] (0,-1) -- (0,1) node[anchor=south] {$\sin(2\theta)$};
				\draw[thick] (-0.2,0) -- (2.2,0) node[anchor=west] {$\theta$};
				\draw (1,0.1) -- (1,-0.1) node[anchor=north] {$45^{\circ}$};
				\draw (2,0.1) -- (2,-0.1) node[anchor=north] {$90^{\circ}$};
				\draw[thick,domain=0:2,variable=\x] plot (\x,{sin(90*\x)});
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}
		\vspace{-10pt}
		\item $\sin(2\theta)$ increases for $0^{\circ}\leq\theta<45^{\circ}$, so $v_{0}$ decreases with increasing $\theta$ for shallower angles.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item At shallow angles, the arrow gains more vertical speed (and thus time of flight) than it loses horizontal speed as $\theta$ increases, so tilting up would increase the range if $v_{0}$ did not decrease.
		\end{itemize}
		\item $\sin(2\theta)$ decreases for $45^{\circ}<\theta\leq90^{\circ}$, so $v_{0}$ increases with increasing $\theta$ for steeper angles.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item At steep angles, the arrow loses more horizontal speed than it gains vertical speed (and thus time of flight) as $\theta$ increases, so tilting up would shorten the range if $v_{0}$ did not increase.
