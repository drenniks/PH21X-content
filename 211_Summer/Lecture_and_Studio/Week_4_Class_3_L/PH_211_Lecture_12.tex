\[
\vec{F}^{net} = m\vec{a} = \vec{0}

From the $x$-component of the net force, we find that the balance of forces and the equal angles require the tensions to be the same. This then can be used to simplify the $y$-component of the net force and solve for this one tension.
\begin{align*}
	0 & = F^{net}_{x} & 0 & = F^{net}_{y} \\
	& = -F^{T}_{GR1}\cos\theta & 0 & = F^{T}_{GR1}\sin\theta + F^{T}_{GR2}\sin\theta - F^{g} \\
	& \quad + F^{T}_{GR2}\cos\theta & 0 & = 2F^{T}\sin\theta - F^{g} \\
	F^{T}_{GR1}\cos\theta & =  F^{T}_{GR2}\cos\theta & 2F^{T}\sin\theta & = F^{g} = mg \\
	F^{T}_{GR1} & =  F^{T}_{GR2} = F^{T} & F^{T} & = \frac{mg}{2\sin\theta} \\

\begin{itemize}
	\item If the ropes are vertical ($\theta=\pi/2$), then they both hang straight down, and they should each support half of the gymnast's weight (they don't need anything extra to pull in the $x$-direction).
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $F^{T} = \frac{mg}{2\sin(\pi/2)} = \frac{mg}{2}$
	\end{itemize}
	\item If the ropes are horizontal with no $y$-component, then they need to be extremely taut. In fact, it is impossible for a rope with weight in the middle not to sag a bit (because the ropes need to be tilted to exert an upward force on the suspended mass), so it should require an unrealistic amount of force to make the ropes completely flat.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $F^{T} = \frac{mg}{2\sin(0)} = \frac{mg}{0} = \infty$
	\end{itemize}
	\item If the gymnast has no mass, then the ropes don't need to exert any force. $F^{T} = \frac{(0\text{ kg})g}{2\sin\theta} = 0$

\textbf{Left vs. Right} \\
Both tensions must have equal $x$-components, as the forces balance in the $x$-direction. We can relate the magnitudes of the $y$-components to the magnitudes of the $x$-components by
\begin{align*}
	|F^{T}_{GR1,y}| & = |F^{T}_{GR1,x}|\tan\theta, & |F^{T}_{GR2,y}| & = |F^{T}_{GR2,x}|\tan\alpha,
\end{align*}
and since the $x$-components are equal, this becomes
\[
\frac{|F^{T}_{GR1,y}|}{|F^{T}_{GR2,y}|} = \frac{\tan\theta}{\tan\alpha}.
\]
Since $\alpha>\theta$, we know that $\tan\alpha>\tan\theta$, and therefore $|F^{T}_{GR2,y}| > |F^{T}_{GR1,y}|$. This tells us that $F^{T}_{GR2} > F^{T}_{GR1}$. The left tension is less than the right tension.

\noindent\textbf{Special Case} \\
If you set $\theta=\alpha$, your equations for both tensions should simplify to what we found before: $F^{T} = \frac{mg}{2\sin\theta}$.

What if the ropes were different angles?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Don't solve the problem yet!
	\item You have a problem like this on your \\
	homework.
	\item Do you expect the left tension to be \textit{greater than}, \\
	\textit{less than}, or \textit{equal to} the right tension?
	\item What special case could you evaluate after you \\
	solve this problem to check if your answer is right?

\begin{itemize}
	\item When an object is at rest or moving at constant speed, the forces balance and the object is in equilibrium.
	\item When an object is accelerating, there is a nonzero net force.
