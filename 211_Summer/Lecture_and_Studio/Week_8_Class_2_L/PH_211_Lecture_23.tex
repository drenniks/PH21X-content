\underline{Announcements} \\
We have learned a lot of topics in this class (kinematics, forces, energy, momentum, and all of their associated equations), and one of the hardest parts of physics can be choosing which method to use. On Friday, we will be going through activities centered around deciding when to choose a particular method.

\noindent $\vec{F}^{net}=\vec{0}$ in I and III, where the surface is flat. \\
$\vec{F}^{net}$ is down the ramp in II, and it doesn't matter which way the ball is moving, so it is the same for both motions.

Trajectories are given in {\color{violet}violet}. Momenta are given in {\color{blue}blue}. As a side note, we can see just from this that $p_{i,y}=p_{f,y}$, as $\Delta\vec{p}$ is only in the $x$-direction. \\

\noindent Though the forces are the same, the ball in 2 spends more time on the ramp (it had less of its initial speed pointing straight down the ramp), so it gets more impulse. As such, its change in momentum is larger in magnitude than that of the ball in 1, but both are in the same direction, as the impulse is in the direction of the net force. \\
Conceptually, the change in momentum in 2 must be larger than the change in momentum in 1, as the momentum change in 2 not only increases the magnitude of the momentum (by the same amount as in 1, since the final momenta are the same; see below), but also must change its direction. This is the reverse triangle inequality:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw[ultra thick,blue,->] (0,0) -- (0.5,-0.5) node[anchor=north east] {$\vec{p}_{i}$} -- (1,-1);
		\draw[ultra thick,blue,->] (1,-1) -- (1.75,-1) node[anchor=north] {$\Delta\vec{p}$} -- (2.5,-1);
		\draw[ultra thick,blue,->] (0,0) -- (1.25,-0.5) node[anchor=south west] {$\vec{p}_{f}$} -- (2.5,-1);
		\node[anchor=west] at (2.5,-0.5) {$|\Delta\vec{p}| = |\vec{p}_{f}-\vec{p}_{i}| \geq |\vec{p}_{f}| - |\vec{p}_{i}|$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{-10pt}
Regarding energy, if we look at this from a conservation of energy perspective, then the ball descends the same height in both motions, so $\Delta U_{g}$ is the same, and thus $\Delta K_{1} = \Delta K_{2}$. Thus, the balls' final speeds (and magnitudes of final momenta) must be the same. \\
From a work perspective, the work done on the ball in motion 1 is just $W_{1} = F\Delta x$, the force down the ramp times the displacement down the ramp. In motion 2, the displacement along the parabolic path is longer, but not in line with the force, so the dot product in $W_{2}=\int\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{x}$ will only keep the parts of the path in line with the force, giving us $W_{1}=W_{2}$.

If we wanted to know about acceleration, forces would make sense, but we just want to know about speed after the objects have moved some distance. We would need to do kinematics to get the final speed. Energy will be more direct, as it works with speed and position directly. \\

\noindent Conservation of Energy: $0 = \Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta K + \Delta U_{g1} + \Delta U_{g2}$ \\
$\Delta K = K_{f}-K_{i} = K_{f} = \frac{1}{2}(m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3})v^{2}$ \\
$\Delta U_{g1} = {\color{violet}-}m_{1}gL\sin\theta_{1}$ \quad Box 1 rises {\color{violet}(lowers)} by $h={\color{violet}-}L\sin\theta_{1}$. \\
$\Delta U_{g1} = \Vpm m_{1}gL\sin\theta_{3}$ \quad Box 3 lowers {\color{violet}(rises)} by $h=\Vpm L\sin\theta_{3}$. \\
Our conservation of energy equation becomes
\[
\frac{1}{2}(m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3})v^{2} \Vmp m_{1}gL\sin\theta_{1} \Vpm m_{3}gL\sin\theta_{3} = 0,
\]
and therefore
\begin{align*}
	v & = \sqrt{\frac{{\color{violet}-}2m_{3}gL\sin\theta_{3} \Vpm 2m_{1}gL\sin\theta_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}}} \\
	& =\sqrt{\frac{2gL}{m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}}}\sqrt{{\color{violet}-}m_{3}\sin\theta_{3}\Vpm m_{1}\sin\theta_{1}}
\end{align*}
We need ${\color{violet}-}m_{3}\sin\theta_{3}\Vpm m_{1}\sin\theta_{1}\geq0$ (otherwise we are taking the square root of a negative number).
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\noindent Slides Right: $m_{3}\sin\theta_{3} > m_{1}\sin\theta_{1}$
	
	{\color{violet}Slides Left: $m_{1}\sin\theta_{1} > m_{3}\sin\theta_{3}$}
\end{multicols}
\vspace{-10pt}
\noindent If $m_{3}\sin\theta_{3} = m_{1}\sin\theta_{1}$, then the boxes stay still. No kinetic energy is gained by sliding, so potential energy is constant, and thus there is no force pushing the system. \\
\textbf{Special Cases}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\theta_{1}=0^{\circ},\ \theta_{3}=90^{\circ} \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{2gLm_{3}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}}}$ sliding right
	\item $\theta_{1}=90^{\circ},\ \theta_{3}=0^{\circ} \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{2gLm_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}}}$ {\color{violet}sliding left}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In both of these cases, we have a single block hanging while two are on a flat surface. There is no condition to keep them stationary, as there is no way to balance the force on the one hanging block. We have also done single hanging block problems that we can compare this to.
	\end{itemize}
	\item $m_{1}=m_{3} \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{2gLm_{1}}{2m_{1}+m_{2}}}\sqrt{{\color{violet}-}\sin\theta_{3}\Vpm\sin\theta_{1}}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In this case, the condition for the boxes to remain stationary is $\theta_{3}=\theta_{1}$, which makes sense, as for equal masses, the forces on $m_{2}$ will be balanced if the other two masses hang symmetrically.
