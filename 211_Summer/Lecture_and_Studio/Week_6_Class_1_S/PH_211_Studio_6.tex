\noindent Since the force is constant in magnitude and direction, the work simplifies to
\[
W = \vec{F}_{0} \cdot \Delta\vec{s}.
\]
\textbf{Case 1} \\
$\vec{F}_{0}$ is parallel to $\Delta\vec{s}$, so $W_{1} = \vec{F}_{0} \cdot \Delta\vec{s} = F_{0}\Delta s > 0$. \\
\textbf{Case 2} \\
$\vec{F}_{0}$ makes an acute angle with $\Delta \vec{s}$ (let's call this angle, the angle $\Delta \vec{s}$ makes below the horizontal, $\theta$), so $W_{2} = \vec{F}_{0} \cdot \Delta\vec{s} = F_{0}\Delta s\cos\theta$, where $0<\cos\theta<1$, so $W_{2}>0$. \\
\textbf{Case 3} \\
$\vec{F}_{0}$ is perpendicular to $\Delta \vec{s}$ so $W_{3} = \vec{F}_{0} \cdot \Delta\vec{s} = 0$. \\
In this case, remember that the push from the hand and the motion of the block are not necessarily related. The block is already moving for some reason, and we choose to push down on it. We may push, and our hand may move with it, but we add no energy to the system by pushing in a direction the block isn't moving. \\

\noindent Since all of the works are nonnegative, they are equal to their absolute values, and we can rank them as follows:
\[
W_{1} > W_{2} > W_{3} = 0.

The work done by a force does not depend on your choice of coordinate system. There are some signs that are coordinate system dependent (such as those applied to the directions of vectors), but those with physical meaning (such as the sign of work, which indicates whether energy is entering or leaving the system) do not. \\

\noindent The work done is negative in stage 1, where the force is opposite the displacement. Energy is subtracted from the system, and the speed of the block decreases. \\

\noindent The work done is positive in stage 2, where the force is in the same direction as the displacement. Energy is added to the system, and the speed of the block increases.

\noindent Pushed inward by the two forces, both blocks will accelerate, so they each have a nonzero final speed. They began at rest, so $K_{i} = 0$ J, and their final kinetic energy is $K_{f} = \frac{1}{2}m_{A}v_{A}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m_{B}v_{B}^{2}$, there fore the change in kinetic energy of the system is positive ($\Delta K > 0$). \\

\noindent The force of the hand on A points right, and its point of application (where the hand is touching the block) is displaced to the right, so the work done by the hand is positive ($W_{A}^{\text{hand}}>0$). \\
For block B, the force of the hand and the displacement are both to the left, so the work is still positive ($W_{B}^{\text{hand}}>0$). \\
Note that $W_{B}^{\text{hand}}$ is not negative due to being ``in the opposite direction.'' The sign of work is determined by the direction of the force relative to the direction of the dipslacment of its point of contact. \\

\noindent The work done by gravity and the work done by the normal force on both blocks are zero ($W_{A}^{g} = W_{B}^{g} = W_{A}^{N} = W_{B}^{N}=0$). Their points of contact are displacing, but the forces are perpendicular to the displacement. \\

\noindent The net work is the sum of the individual works:
\begin{align*}
	W_{AB}^{\text{net}} & = W_{A}^{\text{net}} + W_{B}^{\text{net}} \\
	& = W_{A}^{\text{hand}} + W_{A}^{g} + W_{A}^{N} + W_{B}^{\text{hand}} + W_{B}^{g} + W_{B}^{N} \\
	& = W_{A}^{\text{hand}} + W_{B}^{\text{hand}} \\
	& > 0.
\end{align*}
The net work on the system is positive. \\
Note that the net work is \textbf{not} generally equal to the integral of the net force dotted with the displacement of the center of mass:
\[
W^{\text{net}} \neq \int\vec{F}^{net}\cdot d\vec{s}_{CoM}.
\]
This would give the wrong answer here, as the net force on AB is zero and the center of mass doesn't move. \\

\noindent Since both $W_{AB}^{\text{net}}>0$ and $\Delta K > 0$, our results are consistent with the work-energy theorem. Positive work increases the total energy of the system.

Gravity and the normal force do no work here, so in general, for a force with constant direction:
\[
W^{net} = W^{T} = \int_{0}^{d}\vec{F}^{T}\cdot d\vec{x} = \int_{0}^{d}F^{T}\cos\theta dx = \cos\theta\int_{0}^{d}F^{T}dx.
\]
By the work-energy theorem, $W^{net}=\Delta K$, and since we know $K_{i} = 0$ and $K_{f}=\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}$, this means $v_{f} = \sqrt{\frac{2W^{net}}{m}}$. \\

\noindent\textbf{Case A} \\
For $F^{T} = T_{0}$, we have
\begin{align*}
	W_{T} & = T_{0}\cos\theta\int_{0}^{d}dx = T_{0}d\cos\theta, & v_{f} & = \sqrt{2\frac{T_{0}d}{m}\cos\theta}.
\end{align*}
\textbf{Case B} \\
To get a linear decrease (with respect to $x$) as described, the following equation should be used for the force:
\[
F^{T}(x) = 3T_{0}-\frac{2T_{0}}{d}x.
\]
This gives us
\begin{align*}
	W_{T} & = T_{0}\cos\theta\int_{0}^{d}\left(3-\frac{2}{d}x\right)dx \\
	& = T_{0}\cos\theta\left[3x-\frac{1}{d}x^{2}\right]_{x=0}^{d} \\
	& = T_{0}\cos\theta\left(3d-\frac{1}{d}d^{2}\right) \\
	& = 2T_{0}d\cos\theta, \\
	v_{f} & = 2\sqrt{\frac{T_{0}d}{m}\cos\theta}.
\end{align*}
\textbf{Unit Check} \\
2 and $\cos\theta$ are unitless, and as for the rest,
\[
\left[\sqrt{\frac{T_{0}d}{m}}\right] = \sqrt{\frac{[T_{0}][d]}{[m]}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-2}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{kg}}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{m}^{2}}{\text{s}^{2}}} = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} = [v_{f}].
\]
\textbf{Covariation} \\
Pushing the block harder or pulling it farther will impart more kinetic energy, causing it to end up going faster. This is reflected in our equations, as increasing $T_{0}$ or $d$ causes $v_{f}$ to increase. \\
Pulling at a larger angle to the displacement is less efficient for doing work, and a more massive object resists accelerating more. This is reflected in our equations, as increasing $\theta$ or $m$ causes $v_{f}$ to decrease.

	\item You are pulling a box with known mass $m$ at the angle shown below. The box moves from $x=0$ to $x=d$. Find the work done by the rope in each of the following situations:
	\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
		\item The tension is constant.
		\item The tension decreases linearly from $3T_{0}$ to $T_{0}$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item If the box began at rest, find the \\
	final speed of the box in each of \\
	the situations above.
	\item Don't forget to make sense of \\
	your answers!

\begin{itemize}
	\item Energy is a powerful, ubiquitous concept that can help us solve a wide array of physics problems.
	\item Energy is a \textit{scalar}---it is not a vector.
	\item There are different forms of energy, and energy can be transferred between objects and between forms.
