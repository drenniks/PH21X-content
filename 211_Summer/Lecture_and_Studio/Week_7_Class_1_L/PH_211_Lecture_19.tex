\noindent It is often asserted that energy is always conserved, meaning that energy cannot be created or destroyed within the universe as a whole. \\

\noindent To be more exact and use the idea of energy conservation more practically, we should pick a system and look to the work energy theorem ($W_{\text{net,ext}}=\Delta E_{\text{total}}$) to tell us if energy is conserved for that system. If $W_{\text{net,ext}}=0$, then the energy of the system is conserved, and we can use energy conservation methods to analyze the system. \\

\noindent Assuming that the universe is a closed system, interacting with nothing outside of it, then our more exact idea of energy conservation implies that energy is indeed always conserved on a universal scale.
