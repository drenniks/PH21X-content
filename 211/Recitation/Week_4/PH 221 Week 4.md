## Activities
[[Interactions and the Third Law]]
[[Two Blocks on a Frictionless Half-Ramp]]
## Notes
* Added to Vault 2024 Spring
	* Assignment Format 2024-04-27
	* No instructor notes
	* Students tend to finish this in 35 or so minutes.
* Revised 2024 01 30
	* [[Crate Brick Box Car FBDs]], [[Free Fall from FBD]], and [[Suitcase Pull]] all moved to earlier.
	* [[Interactions and the Third Law]] and [[Two Blocks on a Frictionless Half-Ramp]] brought up from Week 6.
	* Since the second activity is so similar to their homework (albeit frictionless), which they also set up the diagrams for in studio, it might be worthwhile to type up a full version of the other major 3rd law studio problem, with the stacked blocks and the pulley, and use that instead. It would be good to see how the students feel about doing the near-homework problem, though, because they could find it helpful.
