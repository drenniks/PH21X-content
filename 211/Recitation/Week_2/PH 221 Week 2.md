## Notes
* Added to Vault 2024 Spring
	* Assignment Format 2024-02-21
	* One student came up with additional assumptions: no wind; constant density atmosphere.
		* Both (but the second especially) are under the umbrella of assuming a vacuum.
		* Perhaps add these to solution in future, or at least add them as instructor notes (in case having many assumptions becomes confusing to the students).
* Revised 2024 01 14
	* [[Toy Rocket Launch]] delayed with shift of kinematics after forces.
	* [[Crate Brick Box Car FBDs]] brought up from Week 4.
	* [[Free Fall from FBD]] brought up from Week 4.
	* [[Suitcase Pull]] brought up from Week 4.
	* [[Force versus Net Force]] brought up from Week 5.
	* No instructor notes.
