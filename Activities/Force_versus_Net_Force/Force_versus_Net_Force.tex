\Problem{Force versus Net Force}{\FvNFa}{
(a) If an object is at rest can you conclude that there are no forces acting on it? Explain.
}
\Solution{\FvNFaSol}{
No. You can only conclude that the net force on the object is zero.
}
\ProblemSub{\FvNFb}{
(b) If a force is exerted on an object, is it possible for that object to be moving with constant velocity? Explain.
}
\Solution{\FvNFbSol}{
No if it is the only force acting on the object. Yes if it is balanced by other forces so that the net force is zero.
