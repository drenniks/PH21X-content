# Toy Rocket Launch
## Spring 2024
[Toy Rocket Launch TeX](./Toy_Rocket_Launch_2024_04_12.tex)
[Toy Rocket Launch PDF](./Toy_Rocket_Launch_2024_04_12.pdf)
* Added to Vault
	* Assignment Format 2024-02-21
	* One student came up with additional assumptions: no wind; constant density atmosphere.
		* Both (but the second especially) are under the umbrella of assuming a vacuum.
		* Perhaps add these to solution in future, or at least add them as instructor notes (in case having many assumptions become confusing to the students).
