\Problem{Potential versus Change in Potential}{\PotvChPotA}{
(a) If the force on a particle at some point in space is zero, must its potential energy also be zero at that point? Explain.
}
\Solution{\PotvChPotASol}{

No. The rate of change of potential energy with respect to position will be zero at this point. For example, the potential energy can be a nonzero constant in the region that contains this point.

\ProblemSub{\PotvChPotB}{
(b) If the potential energy of a particle at some point in space is zero, must the force on it also be zero at that point? Explain.
}
\Solution{\PotvChPotBSol}{

No. If the potential energy is changing along a line that passes through zero potential at this point, then the force will not be zero.
