	* The spring seems to confuse students. Perhaps the activity should be split apart, with a sled that separates without any explanation as the first part, then introduce the spring as the mechanism in a later synthesis activity.
	* Mention of the capstone lab on elasticity should be removed; that is not what they do in capstone labs anymore.

* Removed mention of capstone lab.
