# Course Outcomes
* analyzing both hypothetical and actual situations to determine the germane principles of physics #outcomes/determine_germane_principles
* making both conceptual and quantitative predictions of behavior based on principles of physics #outcomes/conceptual_and_quantitative_predictions
* testing those predictions using evidence-based results #outcomes/testing_predictions
# Learning Objectives
## Shared
* make observations of physical behavior and find explanations that are consistent with the observations, apply these explanations and the established laws to make predictions about outcomes of experiments, and test the explanations and laws through experimentation #learning_objectives/observations_explanations_predictions_experiments
* represent information in multiple ways (diagrams, graphs, words, equations. etc.), and move from one representation to another, use these representations to set up problem solutions, predict the behaviors of systems, and to check the solutions to problems #learning_objectives/representations
* use critical thinking skills within physics problem solving as described below #learning_objectives/critical_thinking
* analyze an open-ended, new physical situation #learning_objectives/critical_thinking/open-ended_analysis
* consider what assumptions and simplifications can be made to this situation #learning_objectives/critical_thinking/assumptions_and_simplifications  
* break down the situation into manageable pieces #learning_objectives/critical_thinking/manageable_pieces 
* apply the concepts learned to solve these pieces and put them together for a solution #learning_objectives/critical_thinking/apply_concepts 
* evaluate if the solution makes sense #learning_objectives/critical_thinking/sensemaking
