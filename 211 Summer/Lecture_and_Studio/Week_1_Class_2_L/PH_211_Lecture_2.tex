\noindent\textbf{From the Syllabus}

Projects are assignments where you will demonstrate and synthesize what you have learned over many weeks. Projects may take many different potential forms, including written, visual, or video. Almost every week (except for weeks with ungrading), there will be some milestone to complete in this project, such as setting group expectations (if you work in a group), proposing a project, submitting a rough draft, peer reviewing other classmates’ projects, and submitting a final draft. All project milestones are due on Fridays.

The standard format for projects that you can expect if you continue on to 212 is a group assignment (usually 3 students), consisting of a 10-15 minute video solution to a physics problem, with a full calculation, sensemaking, and reflection. You may choose to get used to this format in preparation for continuing on in the sequence, or you can take this opportunity to be more creative in how you approach the project. I vehemently encourage you to find some idea for a project that excites you, be it creating an educational video or report, performing research, melding physics with something artistic, or even something I haven’t considered as a possible physics project yet.

\noindent\textbf{Explanations}

\noindent\textbf{L2-1: Comparing Motion Diagrams}

\noindent\textbf{Principles}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t}$
	\item For a motion diagram, the time intervals are the same.
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Reasoning}

\noindent\textit{Method 1:}

Let us look at the beginning and end of the motion. Each object starts and ends at the same spot:
\[
\Delta\vec{r}_{1} = \Delta\vec{r}_{2} = \Delta\vec{r}.
\]
Object 2 takes more time to get to the final position:
\[
\Delta t_{2} > \Delta t_{1}.
\]
Now we have
\[
\vec{v}_{avg,1} = \frac{\Delta\vec{r}_{1}}{\Delta t_{1}}, \qquad \vec{v}_{avg,2} = \frac{\Delta\vec{r}_{2}}{\Delta t_{2}}.
\]
Since $\Delta\vec{r}$ is the same for both, a larger number in the denominator gives a smaller overall number. Therefore
\[
\left|\vec{v}_{avg,1}\right| > \left|\vec{v}_{avg,2}\right|.
\]

\noindent\textit{Method 2:}

Since the velocity appears to be constant (that is, $\Delta\vec{r}$ between two adjacent spots is the same), we can also look at individual positions.

For object 1, $\Delta\vec{r}$ between times 1 and 2 is greater than for object 2:
\[
\Delta\vec{r}_{1} > \Delta\vec{r}_{2}.
\]
The time between these two points is the same for both objects:
\[
\Delta t_{1} = \Delta t_{2} = \Delta _{t}.
\]
Now we have
\[
\vec{v}_{avg,1} = \frac{\Delta\vec{r}_{1}}{\Delta t}, \qquad \vec{v}_{avg,2} = \frac{\Delta\vec{r}_{2}}{\Delta t}.
\]
The denominators are the same, so having a larger number in the numerator gives a larger overall number. Therefore
\[
\left|\vec{v}_{avg,1}\right| > \left|\vec{v}_{avg,2}\right|.
\]

\noindent\textbf{Conclusion}

The average speed of object 1 is \underline{greater than} the average speed of object 2:
\[
\left|\vec{v}_{avg,1}\right| > \left|\vec{v}_{avg,2}\right|.
\]

\noindent\textbf{L2-2 Thrown Ball}

The ball goes up, slows down, comes to a brief stop, turns around, and falls back down, increasing in speed.

\noindent\textbf{Analyze and Represent}

\noindent\textbf{1a: Understand the Problem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\vec{r}$: position of the ball (subscripts will denote which point in time the position corresponds to)
	\item $\vec{v}$: velocity of the ball (subscripts will denote which point in time the position corresponds to)
	\item $\vec{r}_{1}$: initial position
	\item $\vec{v}_{1}$: initial velocity
	\item $\vec{r}_{7}$: final position
	\item $\vec{v}_{7}$: final velocity
	\item $t$: time
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{1b: Identify Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ball is thrown in a straight line.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This simplification allows us to consider motion in only one dimension.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The ball is released and caught at the same spot.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An actual toss and catch isn't going to be perfect, but small, random differences in starting and ending height are a minor detail that we don't need to bother with when looking at this general sort of motion.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Particle model.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This assumption allows us to ignore any ambiguity in the object's position (we don't have to decide to measure from the center, top, or bottom), and to ignore any rotational motion the object may have about its own axis.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{1c: Represent Physically}

A motion diagram can help us visualize the motion of the ball. The velocity vectors (added based on forward approximation) give us a sense of how fast the ball is moving at each time.

\begin{TeacherMargin}
\noindent\textbf{Forward Approximation}

The velocity at time $t_{j}$ is approximated as the average velocity from $t_{j}$ to $t_{j+1}$:
\[
\vec{v}_{j} \approx \frac{\vec{r}_{j+1}-\vec{r}_{j}}{\Delta t}
\]
Note that this means we can't give a velocity to the final dot, as there is no next dot to get a final position from.

\noindent\textbf{Backward Approximation}

The velocity at time $t_{j}$ is approximated as the average velocity from $t_{j-1}$ to $t_{j}$:
\[
\vec{v}_{j} \approx \frac{\vec{r}_{j}-\vec{r}_{j-1}}{\Delta t}
\]
This time, we can't give a velocity to the first dot, as there is no previous dot to get an initial position from.

\noindent\textbf{Balanced Approximation}

The velocity at time $t_{j}$ is approximated as the average velocity from $t_{j-1}$ to $t_{j+1}$:
\[
\vec{v}_{j} \approx \frac{\vec{r}_{j+1}-\vec{r}_{j-1}}{2\Delta t}
\]
Now, we can't give a velocity to either the first or last dot. Note that we are looking two dots apart, so the time interval is doubled.

\noindent\textbf{Instantaneous}

Here, the velocity is actually calculated as the derivative of a known position equation. Note that the balanced approximation captures the stop at the top best, but it is still overestimating the other vectors.

\noindent\textbf{Motion Graph}

A motion diagram overlays snapshots of the object at different times into a single picture. A motion graph gives time an axis of its own. Each point on the graph has the same $y$ separation as the corresponding points in the motion diagram, but they now also have a separation in $t$ that clarifies at what point they happen in time.

The forward and backward approximations are a bit rough, whereas the balanced approximation is close to the instantaneous velocity. It is still an approximation, though, so it is not perfect.

The approximations of $\vec{v}_{2}$ were brought out from the graph for clarity. The backward approximation is too steep (giving too large of a velocity), and the forward approximation is not steep enough (giving too small of a velocity).

\noindent\textbf{Calculate}

\noindent\textbf{2a: Represent Principles}

Instantaneous velocity at a particular time can be approximated by the average velocity over a span of time containing that particular time:
\[
\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \approx \vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t}.
\]

\noindent\textbf{2b: Find unknown(s) Symbolically}

For the entire motion, the average velocity from start to finish is
\[
\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\vec{r}_{7}-\vec{r}_{1}}{t_{7}-t_{1}} = 0,
\]
because it starts and ends at the same position ($\vec{r}_{7}=\vec{r}_{1}$)!

For the first half, we can calculate the average velocity from the launch to the peak:
\[
\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\vec{r}_{4}-\vec{r}_{1}}{t_{4}-t_{1}}.
\]

For the second half, we can calculate the average velocity from the peak to the catch:
\[
\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\vec{r}_{7}-\vec{r}_{4}}{t_{7}-t_{4}}.
\]
