How is acceleration symbolically related to velocity?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
	\item Velocity is acceleration times $t$.
	\item Acceleration is velocity times $t$.
	\item Acceleration is the derivative of velocity.
	\item Velocity is the derivative of acceleration.

We need $1-\frac{t}{T}$ to be unitless, because 1 is unitless, so $t/T$ must also be. Since $t$ is in seconds, it follows that $T$ must also be.

Note that, when we plug in $t = T$, we find that $\vec{a}(T) = 0\hat{x}$, so the acceleration burst stops after $T$ passes, at which point the acceleration changes direction to bring Vax back to his initial velocity. As such, $T$ can be thought of as the duration of the acceleration burst.

Since $\left(1-\frac{t}{T}\right)\hat{x}$ is unitless, the overall units of the right hand side come from $a_{0}$. We need the right hand side to be an acceleration to match the left, so $a_{0}$ has units of m/s$^{2}$.

Note that, when we plug in $t=0$ s, we find that $\vec{a}(0\text{ s})=a_{0}\hat{x}$, so $a_{0}$ is the magnitude of the initial acceleration.

The unit vector $\hat{x}$ carries all of the direction information. It tells us that the acceleration is in the $x$-direction (though left or right depends on the sign).
