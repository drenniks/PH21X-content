\section*{Challenges in Taking Physics}
``I remember taking my first Physics class as a freshman.
Before coming to college, I didn't worry much about
grades, so I felt unprepared for the increased workload
and differences in grading. I remember being surprised
after getting burned grade-wise several times, and
feeling stressed as a result. But then I got some help
from the instructor and the TA, found a study group, and
was able to turn things around. Looking back now, \textbf{I
think my struggles were pretty normal.} Even though
people don't like to admit it, basically everyone has
trouble with certain concepts. Although it was a
somewhat rocky start, it felt good to learn from my
mistakes, and \textbf{I am proud of the success I have had.}''

``I was one of just a handful of women in one of my intro physics
study groups, and sometimes I felt a little embarrassed to ask
questions. However, \textbf{I quickly learned that other students
usually had the same question I did}, and we all benefitted
from working with each other and learning from each other.
Sometimes I had difficulty with an idea that my classmates
understood. Other times, they struggled with concepts that I
understood. I remember there wasn’t always an ``aha!'' moment,
where everything clicked. It was usually much more gradual,
with some concepts only becoming clear after lots of practice
and discussion with my study group. \textbf{I realized that everyone
struggles some times}, and the important thing is to not give
up and help each other out.”

\section*{Challenges in Taking Physics}
``When I first got here, I was worried because I was really
struggling with some of the physics concepts. \textbf{It felt like
everyone else was doing just fine}, but I just wasn’t sure
if I was cut out for a physics course. At some point during
the first semester, I came to realize that, actually, a lot of
other students were struggling, too. And \textbf{I started to look
at struggling as a positive thing.} After I struggled with a
hard problem and then I talked to other classmates and
my TA about the solution—I realized that all that effort was
worth it because it helped me learn and remember much
more.''
\begin{flushright}
---Aniyah, Pitt Chemical Engineering Graduate
\end{flushright}
``I didn’t go to a very good high school, and \textbf{I was worried that
my high school courses had not prepared me well for
college.} Honestly, when I got here, I thought professors were
scary. I thought they were critical and hard in their grading, and
sometimes it felt like they put things on the quizzes or exams
that we hadn't discussed in class. But then I realized that the
professor wanted me to be able to apply the physics concepts
in many different situations. So I started to study in a way that
would help me do that, and \textbf{I did my best to learn from my
mistakes on quizzes and exams.} And I saw that even when
the professors' grading seemed tough, it didn’t mean they
looked down on me or that I didn’t belong. It was just their way
of motivating high achieving students.''

Additional questions to stimulate group discussion:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why do you think people wonder at first if they belong?
	\item Why do you think people often think they're the only one who worries about whether they fit in in college?
	\item Why and how does people's experience change over time? What do people do that helps them improve their experience with time?
	\item Ask students to share additional experiences that resonate with what the group has been discussing.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Challenges in Taking Physics}
With your small group, discuss what you wrote about in the first Get-Ready activity and the quotes you have just read. Please answer the following questions as a group:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are some common themes across several of the quotes we read?
	\item Why do you think that sometimes students don’t realize that other people are also struggling with the course?
