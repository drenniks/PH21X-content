I am an avid dancer, with interest in ballroom dance, swing, and Argentine tango.

I enjoy games, especially roleplaying games, such as \textit{Dungeons \& Dragons} (especially revised 3rd edition) and \textit{Call of Cthulhu}.

I have played the French horn since 5th grade, and I have some experience with piano, baritone ukulele, and Native American flute. I am early in the process of teaching myself to play the English concertina.

I like to read fantasy and science fiction, and I have some interest in creative writing.

I took German for three years in high school.

My research in physics has been focused on quantum mechanics. My undergraduate research focused on the consistent histories formulation, and my graduate research so far has focused on weak measurement. I find quantum computation and cryptography interesting, but I am not really in a position to change my research direction to those topics at this time.
